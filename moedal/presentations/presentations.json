The red and blue channels of both LHC-exposed and non-LHC exposed plastic were histogrammed to see if anything suggested itself. The pixel values from the background (i.e. non-etch pits) appear to be normally distributed, which could be useful in terms of applying a threshold to identify etch pits automatically.",
