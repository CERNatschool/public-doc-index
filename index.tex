% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
CERN@school is a student-led research programme that brings
CERN into the classroom.
This document provides an index of the
documents,
presentations,
events,
code repositories,
and
publications
related to research and other activities associated with the
programme from June 2012 to December 2016.
It therefore effectively serves as a chronicle of the programme
for this period, covering the national expansion of the CERN@school Timepix detector
network, the launch of the Langton Ultimate Cosmic ray Intensity Detector (LUCID),
the TimPix project (part of ESA astronaut's Principia mission),
and the integration of CERN@school with the Monopole and Exotics Detector
at the LHC (MoEDAL) research programme.
Links and references to all relevant documents, presentations, code, and data
are provided where available.
